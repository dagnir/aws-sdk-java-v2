# __@AWS_JAVA_SDK_VERSION@__ __2017-02-17__
## __AWS Direct Connect__
  - <h3>Features</h3>
    - This update will introduce the ability for Direct Connect customers to take advantage of Link Aggregation (LAG). This allows you to bundle many individual physical interfaces into a single logical interface, referred to as a LAG. This makes administration much simpler as the majority of configuration is done on the LAG while you are free to add or remove physical interfaces from the bundle as bandwidth demand increases or decreases. A concrete example of the simplification added by LAG is that customers need only a single BGP session as opposed to one session per physical connection.

# __1.11.92__ __2017-02-16__
## __AWS Config__
  - <h3>Features</h3>
    - AWS Config now supports a new test mode for the PutEvaluations API. Set the TestMode parameter to true in your custom rule to verify whether your AWS Lambda function will deliver evaluation results to AWS Config. No updates occur to your existing evaluations, and evaluation results are not sent to AWS Config.

## __Amazon Cognito Identity__
  - <h3>Features</h3>
    - Allow createIdentityPool and updateIdentityPool API to set server side token check value on identity pool.

# __1.11.91__ __2017-02-15__
## __AWS Key Management Service__
  - <h3>Features</h3>
    - This release of AWS Key Management Service introduces the ability to tag keys. Tagging keys can help you organize your keys and track your KMS costs in the cost allocation report. This release also increases the maximum length of a key ID to accommodate ARNs that include a long key alias.

## __AWS SDK for Java for OSGi__
  - <h3>Bugfixes</h3>
    - Fixing [Issue #979](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/issues/979) by including the jmespath-java module in the OSGi bundle.

## __Amazon Glacier__
  - <h3>Features</h3>
    - Introduce `ArchiveTransferManaggerBuilder`. This builder allows using references to `AmazonGlacier`, `AmazonSNS` and AmazonSQS` rather than the concrete implementations.

  - <h3>Deprecations</h3>

# __1.11.90__ __2017-02-14__
## __Amazon EC2__
  - <h3>Features</h3>

# __1.11.89__ __2017-02-10__
## __AWS Storage Gateway__
  - <h3>Features</h3>
    - File gateway mode in AWS Storage gateway provides access to objects in S3 as files on a Network File System (NFS) mount point. This is done by creating Nfs file shares using existing APIs CreateNfsFileShare. Using the feature in this update, the customer can restrict the clients that have read/write access to the gateway by specifying the list of clients as a list of IP addresses or CIDR blocks. This list can be specified using the API CreateNfsFileShare while creating new file shares, or UpdateNfsFileShare while update existing file shares. To find out the list of clients that have access, the existing API DescribeNfsFileShare will now output the list of clients that have access.

# __1.11.88__ __2017-02-09__
## __Amazon EC2__
  - <h3>Features</h3>

      This fixes Issue [#1009](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/issues/1009).
    - Fix an integer overflow bug in [`LegacyS3ProgressListener`](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/s3/model/LegacyS3ProgressListener.html). Note that this class is deprecated and users are discouraged from using it.

    - Now includes the option to view the differences between a commit and its parent commit.

## __AWS SDK for Java__
  - <h3>Features</h3>
    - Adding ability to set custom endpoint and signing region on client builders. For example

      ```java
      AmazonSNS client = AmazonSNSClientBuilder.standard().withEndpointConfiguration(new EndpointConfiguration("http://sns-custom-endpoint.amazon.com", "us-east-1")).build();
      ```
      _NB: This should only be used if a custom endpoint is required, the recommended approach for configuring a client is via set/withRegion on the builder_
    - Bundled dependency of AWS SDK jar available as a new maven module 'aws-java-sdk-bundle'. This module includes all service and dependent JARs with third-party libraries relocated to different namespaces.

  - <h3>Deprecations</h3>
    - Deprecating `software.amazon.awssdk.regions.Region.createClient`, clients should be created via their builder implementation for example:

      ```java
      AmazonSNSClientBuilder.standard().withRegion(region).build();
      ```
    - Deprecating client constructors & mutation methods on clients (eg `setRegion`) in favor of creating a client via the client builders. The following mechanism for creating clients is deprecated:

      ```java
      AmazonSNSClient client = new AmazonSNSClient(clientConfiguration); //client constructor is deprecated
      client.setRegion(RegionUtils.getRegion("us-east-1"));              //mutating the client via setRegion is deprecated
      ```

      Clients should now be constructed using the builder:

      ```java
      AmazonSNS client = AmazonSNSClientBuilder.standard().withClientConfiguration(clientConfiguration).withRegion("us-east-1").build();
      ```

## __Amazon EC2 Container Service__
  - <h3>Features</h3>
    - Now supports a state for container instances that can be used to drain a container instance in preparation for maintenance or cluster scale down.

## __Amazon S3__
  - <h3>Deprecations</h3>
    - Deprecating constructors and mutable methods (eg `setConfiguration()`) on [TransferManager](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/blob/master/aws-java-sdk-s3/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/services/s3/transfer/TransferManager.java) in favor of creating via the builder for example:

      ```java
      TransferManager tm = TransferManagerBuilder.standard().withS3Client(s3Client).build();
      ```

# __1.11.83__ __2017-01-20__
## __AWS Certificate Manager__
  - <h3>Features</h3>
    - Updated response elements for DescribeCertificate API in support of managed renewal.

# __1.11.82__ __2017-01-20__
## __Amazon DynamoDB__
  - <h3>Deprecations</h3>
    - Deprecating [waitForActiveOrDelete](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/dynamodbv2/document/Table.html#waitForActiveOrDelete--) and [waitForAllActiveOrDelete](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/dynamodbv2/document/Table.html#waitForAllActiveOrDelete--) methods in Table class which can give incorrect results if they are called immediatedly after creating or deleting a table. This is due to dynamoDb operations being eventually consistent and might take a few seconds to propagate the new status. Use [waitForActive](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/dynamodbv2/document/Table.html#waitForActive--) and [waitForDelete](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/dynamodbv2/document/Table.html#waitForDelete--) instead.
