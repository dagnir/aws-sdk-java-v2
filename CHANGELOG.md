# __1.11.86__ __2017-01-26__
## __AWS CodeDeploy__
  - <h3>Features</h3>
    - This release of AWS CodeDeploy introduces support for blue/green deployments. In a blue/green deployment, the current set of instances in a deployment group is replaced by new instances that have the latest application revision installed on them. After traffic is rerouted behind a load balancer to the replacement instances, the original instances can be terminated automatically or kept running for other uses.

## __AWS Step Functions__
  - <h3>Features</h3>
    - Initial release of a fluent builder API to create state machine JSON documents.

## __Amazon CloudDirectory__
  - <h3>Features</h3>
    - **(New Service)** Amazon Cloud Directory is a component of the AWS Directory Service that simplifies the development and management of cloud-scale web, mobile and IoT applications. This guide describes the Cloud Directory operations that you can call programatically and includes detailed information on data types and errors. For information about AWS Directory Services features, see [AWS Directory Service](https://aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/) and the [AWS Directory Service Administration Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/what_is.html).

## __Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud__
  - <h3>Features</h3>
    - Adds instance health check functionality to replace unhealthy EC2 Spot fleet instances with fresh ones.

## __Amazon Relational Database Service__
  - <h3>Features</h3>
    - Snapshot Engine Version Upgrade

## __Amazon S3__
  - <h3>Features</h3>
    - Adding [builder](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/blob/master/aws-java-sdk-s3/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/services/s3/AmazonS3EncryptionClientBuilder.java) for AmazonS3EncryptionClient.
    - Adding `disableParallelDownloads` option to [TransferManagerBuilder](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/blob/master/aws-java-sdk-s3/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/services/s3/transfer/TransferManagerBuilder.java#L400).

  - <h3>Deprecations</h3>
    - Constructors on the AmazonS3EncryptionClient have been deprecated in favor of using the AmazonS3EncryptionClientBuilder.

# __1.11.85__ __2017-01-25__
## __Amazon Relational Database Service__
  - <h3>Features</h3>
    - Cross Region Read Replica Copying

## __Elastic Load Balancing__
  - <h3>Features</h3>
    - Application Load Balancers now support native Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). With this ability, clients can now connect to the Application Load Balancer in a dual-stack mode via either IPv4 or IPv6.

# __1.11.84__ __2017-01-24__
## __AWS CodeCommit__
  - <h3>Features</h3>
    - Now includes the option to view the differences between a commit and its parent commit.

## __AWS SDK for Java__
  - <h3>Features</h3>
    - Adding ability to set custom endpoint and signing region on client builders. For example

      ```java
      AmazonSNS client = AmazonSNSClientBuilder.standard().withEndpointConfiguration(new EndpointConfiguration("http://sns-custom-endpoint.amazon.com", "us-east-1")).build();
      ```
      _NB: This should only be used if a custom endpoint is required, the recommended approach for configuring a client is via set/withRegion on the builder_
    - Bundled dependency of AWS SDK jar available as a new maven module 'aws-java-sdk-bundle'. This module includes all service and dependent JARs with third-party libraries relocated to different namespaces.

  - <h3>Deprecations</h3>
    - Deprecating `software.amazon.awssdk.regions.Region.createClient`, clients should be created via their builder implementation for example:

      ```java
      AmazonSNSClientBuilder.standard().withRegion(region).build();
      ```
    - Deprecating client constructors & mutation methods on clients (eg `setRegion`) in favor of creating a client via the client builders. The following mechanism for creating clients is deprecated:

      ```java
      AmazonSNSClient client = new AmazonSNSClient(clientConfiguration); //client constructor is deprecated
      client.setRegion(RegionUtils.getRegion("us-east-1"));              //mutating the client via setRegion is deprecated
      ```

      Clients should now be constructed using the builder:

      ```java
      AmazonSNS client = AmazonSNSClientBuilder.standard().withClientConfiguration(clientConfiguration).withRegion("us-east-1").build();
      ```

## __Amazon EC2 Container Service__
  - <h3>Features</h3>
    - Now supports a state for container instances that can be used to drain a container instance in preparation for maintenance or cluster scale down.

## __Amazon S3__
  - <h3>Deprecations</h3>
    - Deprecating constructors and mutable methods (eg `setConfiguration()`) on [TransferManager](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/blob/master/aws-java-sdk-s3/src/main/java/com/amazonaws/services/s3/transfer/TransferManager.java) in favor of creating via the builder for example:

      ```java
      TransferManager tm = TransferManagerBuilder.standard().withS3Client(s3Client).build();
      ```

# __1.11.83__ __2017-01-20__
## __AWS Certificate Manager__
  - <h3>Features</h3>
    - Updated response elements for DescribeCertificate API in support of managed renewal.

# __1.11.82__ __2017-01-20__
## __Amazon DynamoDB__
  - <h3>Deprecations</h3>
    - Deprecating [waitForActiveOrDelete](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/dynamodbv2/document/Table.html#waitForActiveOrDelete--) and [waitForAllActiveOrDelete](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/dynamodbv2/document/Table.html#waitForAllActiveOrDelete--) methods in Table class which can give incorrect results if they are called immediatedly after creating or deleting a table. This is due to dynamoDb operations being eventually consistent and might take a few seconds to propagate the new status. Use [waitForActive](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/dynamodbv2/document/Table.html#waitForActive--) and [waitForDelete](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/dynamodbv2/document/Table.html#waitForDelete--) instead.
